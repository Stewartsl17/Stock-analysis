# Stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

Our client, Steve, is analyzing stock data from the last couple of years, specifically 2017 and 2018, to look at trends among green energy companies for his parents who are interested in investing. He has created a [excel file](https://github.com/Stewartsl17/Stock-analysis/blob/master/VBA_Challenge.xlsm) with different stocks including the one that his parents are most interested in, DAQO New Energy Corp, which has the ticker "DQ". He has asked for our help with his analysis due to the large size of the data set. We have utilized VBA in order to automate the task and help him to look into various years in a quicker timeframe. However, after seeing the speed of the inital analysis of DQ, he wants to expand the dataset and find trends there. 

## Purpose 

The purpose of the second task was to not only provide the same information for other stocks as we had for DQ, but to test refactoring of initial VBA script to assist Steve with his interest into diversifying his parents' portfolio. 

## Results

As stated before, we utilized VBA programming to vizualize and analyze stock data from 2017 and 2018. Our worksheets includes the following colums of data: Stock Name (by ticker), Total Volume of stock, and Stock Return. 

Two main analyses were conducted during our exercise: 

*2017 vs. 2018 stock performance 
*Execution times between our intial VBA script of all stocks that we explored versus the refactored VBA script
